# Fedora Mint-Cinnamon Flavor 
Originally, a ripoff of Fedora KDE Minimal Install. Now, a copycat of Linux Mint but its actually Fedora

WIP

All scripts need a good old "sudo chmod +x" in order to work

# Missing
Make a master script to automatize everything

Compare default Fedora cinnamon keybinds with Linux Mint ones

Configure some names on menu

Automatically apply mint themes via "gsettings set org.cinnamon.theme name"

Make scripts to help nvidia and amd users that also want hardware acceleration

Make a help script to install fcitx (just like in linux mint)

(Maybe) make a small gui with python or another language

Find/Make a copr to provide xviewer, bulky, thingy, sticky, xplayer, hypnotix (I might also be missing another package)
